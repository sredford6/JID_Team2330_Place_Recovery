## Introduction

The project is a mobile application for mental health and risk stratification based on neighborhood characteristics for both Apple and Android platforms. Virtually no research exists examining the daily influence of environmental factors on the development of mental health disorders such as schizophrenia. Our solution is a mobile app that collects real-time data (daily survey) on the status of the user’s mental health such as their feelings and emotions in relation to their location during the day. We can compile and organize this data into a database for our client and other clinicians to analyze and can better treat their own patients and gain knowledge of the development of mental health disorders.

**The app is available for both iOS and Android platforms.**

### Known Issues
- DateTimePicker has problems on Android, work fine on iOS.
- Haven't tested the case where there are no GPS signals.
- The notification might not work properly if the users change the system time. Users can reset notification schedules if the notification don't work.
- The notification works on Expo Go but seems have problem on iOS.

### Fixed Bugs
- Fixed locations not working on Android devices.


## How to Run
- First, make sure you have installed [Node 16 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater installed.
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- On Visual Studio Code: Create a new terminal via the Terminal menu with Terminal > New Terminal.
- Install the latest verion of Expo CLI: 
```bash 
npm i -g expo-cli
```

- Make sure you have downloaded the project files. Go under the project directory, and install all dependencies:
```bash
cd ./app/src
npm i
```
- Start the project with
```bash
expo start
``` 
- Scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS) to run the app on your phone.
- To run the server locally,  go under the server directory:
```bash
cd ./server
```
- Then follow the instructions in `server/README.md` to run the server.
- To submit the app to Apple App Store and Google Play Store, please follow the [EAS Submit](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/introduction/) instructions.

## Troubleshooting
1.	Users can’t receive notification.
- Notification seems to have bugs after we did beta testing on Apple TestFlight. Users can try to reset their notification schedules by long pressing the “Not Available” or “Start” button on the home screen. There will be an option to reset the notification. Please reload the app after reset.
2.	The app can’t automatically sign in or can’t load the questionnaire. 
- When opening the app, the app should be able to automatically sign users in if they have signed in before. However, the app currently doesn’t have a loading screen, so the users might need to wait a few seconds depending on the network conditions.
3.	Users can’t submit the questionnaire.
- The app will fetch users’ location when they are answering the questionnaire. When the click “Submit”, the app will check if the location is fetched. If not, it might take a few seconds to fetch the location again and upload the answers to backend (which can also take a few seconds depending on the network conditions). Users can wait a few seconds and the answers should be recorded automatically. 
4.	Some Android users might can’t submit questionnaire.
- This is a problem of expo-location (a package we used) on some Android devices. During our beta testing, we identified the problem and tried to fix it, and the location services worked on the Android device we used. However, there might be some edge cases for other Android devices that we haven’t tested on.
